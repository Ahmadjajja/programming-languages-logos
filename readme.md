**Programming languages** are the way we developers talk with the machine, but what happens when we want to talk about them? Probably in a blog post, in a Medium story, in a presentation, or ðŸ¤” well something else ..., **the thing** is that we want to include them in our life and the best way to do it is with a logo.

This project include high resolution `.png` with transparent backgrounds programming languages logos with different dimensions and also a vector `.svg` version of them.

A complete list of the logos can be found int the [`src/`][src] directory.

##### Dimensions

- `16 x 16`
- `24 x 24`
- `32 x 32`
- `48 x 48`

- `512 x 512`

Default logo: `2048 x 2048`
